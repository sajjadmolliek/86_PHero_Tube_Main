        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center mt-10 underline">Discussion about the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <p class="p-10"><span class="font-bold">In JavaScript,</span> users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const. In this article, we will see the differences between the var, let, and const keywords. We will discuss the scope and other required concepts about each keyword.<br><br>

            <span class="font-bold">JavaScript var keyword:</span> The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. <br><br>
            
            <span class="font-bold">Scope:</span> Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. <br><br>
                    
            <span class="font-bold">Example 1:</span> Variable ‘a’ is declared globally. So, the scope of the variable ‘a’ is global, and it can be accessible everywhere in the program. The output shown is in the console.</p>

    <div>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center mt-10 underline">Discussion about the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p class="p-10"> <span class="font-bold">NULL:</span> We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming. <br><br>

Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.<br><br>

When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.</p>



<p class="p-10"> <span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span> There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly.<br><br>

    As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.<br><br>
    
    Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center mt-10 underline">What is a REST API?</h1>
        <p class="p-10">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs. <br><br>
            First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.</p>
